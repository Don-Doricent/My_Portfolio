> Software Developer & Web Wizard

As a Software Engineer at 100devs, I've been immersed in the world of modern web development since August 2022. Working collaboratively with a team of skilled developers, I've honed my craft in building responsive, semantically structured full-stack web applications. Embracing agile methodologies such as SCRUM, I've become adept at project management, ensuring efficient and successful project delivery.

My recent projects exemplify my commitment to designing and developing web solutions that captivate and engage users. "Splash of Glam," a full-stack web app, stands as a testament to my abilities in showcasing a client's product offerings and services through intuitive navigation and interactive features, enhancing user experience and customer engagement. Likewise, "Spectral Barbershop," another full-stack web app, highlights my proficiency in creating dynamic, user-friendly websites that elevate a business's online presence.

Currently, I'm working on the "100Hours Project," a full-stack app designed to meet the needs of investors of all levels, showcasing my dedication to ongoing innovation and skill development. In addition to these projects, my portfolio includes "Project Next," a static site, and the "Cordoba Art" website, reflecting my versatility and adaptability across various client needs.

Whether you're a business seeking to establish a compelling online presence or an employer looking for a dedicated developer to elevate your team, I'm ready to collaborate and bring your digital vision to life.
